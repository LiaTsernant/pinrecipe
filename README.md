# Welcome to Pinrecipe :spaghetti: :pizza: :cookie:

As two food lovers, who like to test yummy recipes and who never found a perfect service to keep the favorite recipes together, we decided to make our own app to serve this purpose.
Pinrecipe is like Pinterest, but for recipes.
You can safely store your favorite recipes and browse for new ones by category: breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert.

#
Thanks to our instructors:
 - Kenny Bushman,
 - Allen Wright,
 - Carson Butterfield,

 you helped us to go through the first full-stack project and be happy with it.
